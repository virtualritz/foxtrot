/*!
`cdt` is a library for calculating
[Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) and
[constrained Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Delaunay_triangulation)
triangulations.

It is optimized for correctness and speed, using exact predicates to perform
point-in-circle and orientation tests.

# Examples
## Delaunay triangulation
This triangulates a set of four points in a square
```rust
let pts = vec![(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0)];
let triangles = cdt::triangulate_points(&pts).unwrap();
assert!(triangles.len() == 2);
for t in triangles {
    println!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", pts[t.0], pts[t.1], pts[t.2])
}
```

## Constrained Delaunay triangulation
This triangulates an inner and outer square
```rust
let pts = vec![(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0),
               (0.2, 0.2), (0.8, 0.2), (0.8, 0.8), (0.2, 0.8)];
let triangles = cdt::triangulate_contours(&pts,
        &[vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 0], vec![4, 5, 6, 7, 4]])
    .unwrap();
for t in triangles {
    println!("{:?} {:?} {:?}", pts[t.0], pts[t.1], pts[t.2])
}
```

# Crate features
By default, the library uses `u32` indexes for internal data structures,
to improve performance.  If you are planning to triangulate more than 500M
points in a single pass, you should enable the `long-indexes` feature.
